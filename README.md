# TheCocktailDB
### Maxbitsolution Test Task

This project is a simple replica of [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/), developed as a test task for Maxbitsolution.

## Key Highlights:
- **Styled Components** were selected for styling due to their flexibility and ease of use. However, the same functionality can be achieved with SCSS or similar technologies, if preferred.
- The **Redux store** is implemented using **RTK Query** without the need for an explicit declaration of the cocktail list after fetching. RTK Query serves both as a store and caching mechanism, which is sufficient for the requirements of this task.
- The app fetches a list of cocktails from the provided API and displays the first element, consistent with how it's handled on the original TheCocktailDB application.

Feel free to explore the app. Feedback is welcome!
